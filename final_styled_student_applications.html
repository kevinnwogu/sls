      Early Career Goals: Define your current early career goals and your motivation for establishing them. (150 word minimum):

    </td>
    <td>
     I understand that the program is seeking students majoring in business or technology, and my biology background is nontraditional. However, I believe that my career interests connect to both the sciences and business, as I plan to achieve a dental degree and a Masters of Business Administration. My current goal is to pursue a career in dentistry, driven by my desire to foster the longevity of young children’s lives by improving the health of their teeth. By becoming a dentist, I hope to make patients feel comfortable during visits and teach them that appointments should not be anxiety-inducing. Dentistry will allow me to uplift others, since a great smile radiates joy, confidence, health, and vitality. I am most interested in opening my own dental practice, which will require me to merge my love for the sciences with my interests in the business sector. I plan to study marketing strategies, strategic planning, insurance billing, and more while I earn my dental degree and MBA. A large motivation for my desire to become a dentist is to bridge gaps that prevent the less-fortunate from receiving adequate dental care. A pivotal moment that sparked my interest in dentistry was volunteering with the dual-language program at Smyrna Elementary School. This volunteering experience exposed me to the importance of cultural competency within the field of healthcare and highlighted the need to remove language barriers and ensure healthcare information is accessible to everyone. My career as a dentist will be focused on preventive care, public health, and serving the less-fortunate who often do not receive adequate dental care.

      Early Career Journey: Describe your journey to achieving your early career goals, thus far. Be sure to consider areas in which you may have struggled, pivoted, and/or thrived. (150 word minimum)

    </td>
    <td>
     Since becoming interested in a career in dentistry, I have devoted my time to gaining experience in the field. As a sophomore at Spelman College, I have explored various facets of medicine and dentistry. Last summer, I participated in the Summer Health Professions Education Program at Columbia University where  I learned valuable information about the dental school experience. I have also shadowed both a general dentist and a pediatric dentist throughout the school year and experienced hands-on patient care. 
My exposure to healthcare began after working as an intern at Emory Hospital of Decatur, Georgia after my senior year of high school. This experience allowed me to explore multiple aspects of hospital operations, by shadowing the Chief Financial Officer, and the clinical side by observing nurses in various units. These experiences highlighted the importance of patient care, administrative efficiency, and cultural competency. While I have been largely successful on my journey to achieving my early career goals, I also learned the power of a pivot while at Spelman. I went from a time in high school where I was overwhelmingly told yes and had to digest the idea of hearing “no”. I applied to various programs this past semester and received several “we regret to inform you” emails. It began to make me feel like all of my previous accomplishments did not hold weight. I am learning to understand the idea that rejection is redirection, and continue to adapt and change. In learning the art of a pivot, I have explored my various passions that enhance my leadership, communication, and passions. I was a member of the Spelman College Speech and Debate team where I enhanced my communication skills and found new means of self expression. I also began an on-campus running club with a close friend called “Soul Sunday” where we run on Sundays and focus on fitness, emotional well-being, and recharging. In addition to becoming a campus tour guide and a member of Collegiate 100, these journeys have helped me thrive on my career journey helping me becoming more passionate, personable, and interact with a diverse network of individuals. I have learned to continually explore my passions and seek programs that will develop my leadership competencies and prepare me for success in the workforce.

      How Can SLS Help?: How do you feel your participation in the Servant Leader Scholars program would help you achieve your early career goals?
     </b>
    </td>
    <td>
     I believe that becoming a Servant Leader Scholar will be extremely beneficial on my journey to early career success. I am seeking the professional development that will expose me to mentorship, personal development coaching, and prepare me to be the best candidate when applying for career-related opportunities. Because I feel very passionate about dentistry, I believe that the program will help me align my passions and interests with my career goals to become a great applicant. As a STEM student, it is often easy to ignore my other passions and limit myself to solely exploring the sciences. However,  I believe that participating in SLS will allow my college experience to be diverse, extensive, and interdisciplinary. Thus, I am interested in the professional development workshops at Microsoft and Google and the access to certifications in Data Analytics and AI as these fields are extremely pertinent to the increasingly technological world. Further, I believe the program will enhance my passion for community service. I recognize the privilege I have been afforded to receive a renowned education and participate in various development programs so I am excited to return gifts of service to the community. While researching, I was extremely inspired by the opportunity to partake in the Day of Service Initiative that would allow me to give back to the community. I love participating in days in service because they are extremely uniting and inspiring. Further, I believe the program will reinforce my confidence in my ability to adequately serve my community and provide me a platform to spread my love for service. Ultimately I am extremely excited to participate in the Servant Leader Scholars Program and am confident it will shape my life.

     From a young age, I was always curious about how things worked, whether it was understanding how my favorite apps were built or learning how technology and businesses operate. This curiosity has shaped my goal to become a systems analyst, where I can bridge the gap between technology and business. What motivates me is the opportunity to help businesses solve real problems and make their systems run more smoothly. I get excited when I see how small changes can have a huge impact, whether that’s helping a business run more efficiently or improving the overall user experience. I want to be someone who transforms complex tech issues into simple, practical solutions that drive growth and help businesses tackle their most important challenges. By combining my passion for technology with my growing interest in business, I hope to make a meaningful impact and help organizations thrive in a constantly changing world.

     As a freshman majoring in Management Information Systems at the University of Georgia, I’m just beginning my journey toward becoming a systems analyst. I’ve already started building a strong foundation by taking courses in information systems and learning about data management and analytics, which are giving me the technical skills I need for my future career.

Outside of the classroom, I’ve been actively involved in extracurricular activities that are helping me develop both professional and leadership skills. As Treasurer of Minorities in Tech, I’ve gained valuable experience managing budgets and working on initiatives to foster diversity in the tech field. I’m also a member of the Black Business Student Association, where I’ve built connections and learned more about navigating the professional world as a minority. One of my most important experiences so far has been being selected for the Keystone Fellowship, which has helped me develop leadership, communication, and teamwork skills. I’m also participating in the Consulting Career Prep Fellowship with Management Leaders of Tomorrow, which has helped me improve my business strategy knowledge and connect with others who share my career goals.

While I’ve made progress, I’ve also faced challenges. Balancing academics with extracurricular activities has been tough at times, and I’ve had to learn how to manage my time more effectively. At first, I struggled with adjusting to the workload, but over time, I’ve learned to prioritize tasks and stay organized. I’ve also had to push myself out of my comfort zone, whether it’s by leading projects or networking with professionals, which hasn’t always been easy. But through these challenges, I’ve become more confident in my abilities and have learned to adapt quickly.

Through these experiences, I’ve strengthened my leadership skills, built a strong professional network, and improved my problem-solving abilities. I know that becoming a systems analyst will require ongoing learning, persistence, and adaptability, but I’m confident that the combination of my academic work, extracurricular involvement, and mentorship will help me reach my early career goals.

     My current early career goals are to commission as a second lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps. In the Marine Corps, I want to focus on cyber command, where I can help protect and strengthen our nation’s cybersecurity. Technology is a powerful tool, and I hope to use my skills and leadership to tackle new challenges and keep our systems safe. My drive for this path comes from a deep sense of service—to my country and my community. Growing up in Memphis, TN, I saw firsthand how strong leadership and resilience can make a difference. Experiences like riding along with the Murrieta Police Department and being part of organizations like the National Society of Black Engineers, Lytehouse, and the Morehouse Resident Housing Association have all shaped my passion for serving and leading with purpose.

     My journey toward becoming a Marine Corps officer in cyber command has been filled with growth, discovery, and resilience. Every step has taught me something new and helped shape the person I’m becoming. One of the toughest challenges I’ve faced is balancing the demands of being a computer science major with my extracurricular commitments. The hours spent coding and solving complex problems can be exhausting, and there have been moments when it felt overwhelming. But those challenges have pushed me to become better at managing my time and staying focused. I’ve also learned to lean on my support system whether it’s professors, classmates, or mentors who’ve helped me stay on track and keep moving forward. A major turning point for me was joining the Naval ROTC program. It was more than just a new commitment; it required a shift in how I approach life. The discipline and structure I’ve gained, along with the leadership training and Naval Science courses, have given me a strong foundation. More importantly, they’ve reaffirmed my passion for leading with integrity and purpose. I’ve found that I thrive most when I’m in leadership roles. As Public Relations Director and Stroll Coach for the Morehouse Resident Housing Association, I developed skills in communication and team management, which have been invaluable. Being part of Lytehouse has taught me accountability through mentoring others, while my involvement with the National Society of Black Engineers has strengthened my technical skills and introduced me to a supportive community of like-minded individuals. Looking back, I see how each experience whether a struggle, a pivot, or a success has played a role in preparing me for what’s ahead. These moments have not only reinforced my goals but also shown me the value of persistence, adaptability, and a clear sense of purpose.

Through organizations like Girl Scouts and Hands On Atlanta, I’ve witnessed the transformative power of community-driven impact, which drives my desire to give back.  

My goal is to combine my passion for technology with my commitment to equity, ensuring that education becomes a bridge to opportunity for all.

     My journey to achieving my early career goals has been a blend of challenges and growth. One of the struggles I’ve faced has been connecting with peers, especially during my transition into college. It took time for me to adjust to the pace and social environment of college life. The academic demands, coupled with the changes in my personal and social life, created a sense of disconnection early on. I initially found it difficult to balance my studies with maintaining meaningful relationships, which made the transition seem even harder. However, I soon realized that this adjustment period was a part of the process, and that feeling uncertain at times was normal.

Where I’ve thrived is in pushing myself to put myself out there and exploring what college has to offer. Joining organizations like Rise in Computing and National Society of Black Engineers has allowed me to meet like-minded individuals and build a supportive community. Participating in events and projects has not only strengthened my technical skills but also given me confidence in interacting with others and developing leadership qualities. These experiences have helped me become more resilient and focused on my long-term goals. They’ve also reinforced my passion for technology and my commitment to empowering others, particularly young women, to pursue careers in computer science.

     My early career goal is to become an environmental impact assessor, a role that perfectly aligns with my academic background in economics and environmental studies and my passion for sustainability and environmental justice. This career path will allow me to evaluate and mitigate the environmental consequences of development projects while ensuring they are both sustainable and equitable. By prioritizing environmental justice, I aim to address the systemic disparities that disproportionately affect underrepresented communities, particularly in urban areas like Atlanta, Georgia.

My motivation for pursuing this goal stems from both personal experiences and academic insights. I always knew I wanted my career to focus on helping people. So I asked myself, what are some global problems that will help communities? One problem is the environment, which resonated with me. I grew up witnessing environmental injustices in metro Atlanta counties. The Northside counties always seemed to appear cleaner than the Southside areas, and I always wondered why. Observing the environmental challenges within my community instilled in me a deep desire to advocate for solutions that foster healthier and more equitable environments locally, nationally, and globally. These experiences have shaped my commitment to bridging the gap between environmental stewardship and social equity.

Academically, my studies have equipped me with a unique perspective. My economics major allows me to analyze the financial and operational dynamics of industries, while my environmental studies minor provides the scientific and policy-based framework necessary to understand and address environmental risks. This interdisciplinary approach positions me to evaluate development projects holistically, balancing economic growth with ecological preservation and social justice.

I am particularly driven by the opportunity to empower marginalized communities through my work. I aim to ensure that industries prioritize solutions that not only minimize environmental harm but also amplify the voices and needs of affected communities. Whether it’s by recommending sustainable practices, advocating for inclusive development, or fostering community engagement, my goal is to drive systemic change that benefits both people and the planet.

Ultimately, my early career goal reflects my commitment to creating a world where progress is defined by equity, sustainability, and resilience. This journey represents more than professional ambition; it is a purpose rooted in my desire to leave a lasting impact on the environment and society.

     My journey toward becoming an environmental impact assessor has been one of growth, resilience, and learning. As an economics major and environmental studies minor at Spelman College, I’ve built a strong academic foundation that has deepened my understanding of sustainability and environmental justice. This multidisciplinary approach has allowed me to analyze the economic implications of environmental practices and develop strategies for equitable solutions.

Moreover, my career goal aligns closely with my leadership experiences, which have allowed me to take an active role in advocating for environmental equity and empowering others to create meaningful change. Serving as the NAACP Youth and College Chairperson has given me a platform to champion environmental justice issues, organize initiatives that uplift marginalized communities, and ensure that their voices are represented in critical discussions. Leading these efforts has sharpened my ability to address complex challenges while working collaboratively with stakeholders to achieve tangible results.

Similarly, my mentorship role with Collegiate 100 has enhanced my ability to guide and inspire others. By mentoring young leaders, I’ve developed skills in communication, empathy, and strategic thinking, all of which are essential for driving community-focused solutions in my future career. These experiences have deepened my understanding of the systemic barriers that many communities face, reinforcing my commitment to using my expertise to create equitable and sustainable outcomes.

Leadership has been a defining element of my journey, providing me with the tools to engage communities, advocate for solutions, and inspire action. These skills are integral to my vision as an environmental impact assessor, where I aim to not only evaluate development projects but also champion systemic change that prioritizes equity and sustainability. Through my leadership, I hope to build partnerships that bridge the gap between industries, policymakers, and communities, creating a lasting impact on both the environment and society.

However, the journey has not been without challenges. The community of black women environmentalist is relatively small, with niche networking opportunities. I knew that if I wanted to grow my network in the environmentalism industry, I must take sacrifices. Therefore, for the first time ever, I travelled across the country to Seattle, Washington to broaden my network and propel my career. For two months, I navigated living in a foreign place, while learning new concepts to the world of environmentalism. Balancing both responsibilities were difficult, but in retrospect, I am now wiser, more resilient, and ambitious to excel in my personal and professional endeavors. Gaining comprehensive insights and hands-on-experiences into policy making, project management, and finances, has equipped me with the technical skills needed to achieve my early career goals as an Environmental Impact Assessor. 

Recently, I’ve pivoted toward developing strategic consulting skills to understand how nonprofits and private sectors transition to sustainable practices. I believe my career as an Environmental Impact Assessor will entail working with different business sectors, prompting me to gain diverse experiences with business frameworks. This exploration has reinforced my belief in the intersection of sustainability and economics and taught me valuable skills that can be applied to my career interests. 

In conclusion, each step, whether challenging or rewarding, has brought me closer to fulfilling my career aspirations.

The program’s emphasis on professional development and mentorship would allow me to refine critical skills like project management and leadership, both of which are essential for navigating complex environmental challenges and advocating for sustainable practices.

The opportunity to engage in workshops with companies like Microsoft and Google, coupled with access to Google Career Certifications, would enhance my technical knowledge in data analytics and project design; key areas in assessing environmental impact and creating actionable strategies. Additionally, the focus on active service learning would give me hands-on experience leading impactful initiatives, allowing me to better understand how to collaborate with stakeholders and implement sustainable solutions in underserved communities.

In addition to the Servant Leader Scholars Program developing my professional skills, I will be granted an invaluable opportunity to connect with fellow students from across Georgia. This diverse network of like-minded peers would expose me to a wide range of perspectives, experiences, and ideas that can shape and enrich my understanding of leadership and service. Collaborating with students from different backgrounds and communities would allow me to learn about the unique environmental and social challenges they face, broadening my own approach to tackling systemic inequities.

Hearing their stories and sharing my own would create a collaborative learning environment where we can collectively develop innovative solutions to issues affecting our communities. These connections would help me refine my ability to work with diverse groups; an essential skill in the field of environmental impact assessment, where collaboration with varied stakeholders is key.

Moreover, the $500 scholarship and 1:1 career services would alleviate financial barriers while preparing me to present myself as a competitive candidate for internships and entry-level roles. 

The program’s holistic approach aligns with my passion for environmental justice and will provide the professional and personal growth needed to make a meaningful impact in my career.

     My early career goals are to attend UCLA Law School and become a lawyer.  I want to attend UCLA law school because of its excellence and due to the fact that I want to live in California when I get out of undergraduate college. Right now, I'm not sure what field I want to focus on, although I'm leaning toward corporate and entertainment law. I knew I wanted to do something that involves writing or speaking in front of an audience since I enjoy writing, arguing, and public speaking.  My motivation for establishing my current career goals comes from the fact that the legal field is so diverse and allows me to use my strengths for my career. My aunt, a lawyer, advised me to pursue law as well. I've always wanted to do something that included helping people, and I think that practicing law will allow me to do just that.

     My path to reaching my early professional goals has been a rocky road, but it has been full of important lessons. During my time in college, I've reached out to attorneys and lawyers in my area and I've been receiving helpful advice on what to do and strategies to remember as I move forward. In order to improve my grades, I've also learnt new study methods and learning strategies while I've been in college. I've been reading and writing constantly so that I can be at least somewhat ready for the reading and writing that comes with law school when the time comes. An area in which i stuggled in at first was studying. I struggled with studying at first because I didn't have to study much in high school, but thanks to professional techniques, I've learned how to learn properly and my grades have improved significantly. Networking has been one area in which I have thrived. I've met a lot of lawyers from various fields thanks to my campus Pre-Law society, which has helped me learn about the various fields and what I could like and dislike.

     Career and personal development is one area where this curriculum would undoubtedly be beneficial. The value of a mentor at college cannot be overstated, and I really believe that if I have a professional who is rooting for me and wants to see me succeed, the possibilities are endless. I also think that college is the best time in life to grow, and I think that personal growth is crucial, especially since I'm transitioning from a college student to a professional lawyer. I think that this advice can help me learn about professional norms and provide the support I need to succeed.

     My current early career goals are to gain experience in the nonprofit sector, develop skills in digital marketing, data analytics, and project management, and continue expanding my network while seeking lifelong collaborators. My motivation to gain experience in the nonprofit sector stems from my ultimate goal of becoming a social entrepreneur and establishing my own enterprise. Specifically, I dream of creating an arts-based company that provides services such as art therapy for traumatized individuals, artistic exploration, and other creative opportunities for youth in low-income communities who lack access to the arts, all while fostering social impact and community empowerment. My drive to develop my business skills comes from my desire to be a well-rounded business woman, while my motivation to expand my network and seek lifelong collaborators arises from my recognition of the vital role community plays in business and how the people in your circle can positively influence the impact you aim to create.

     I am currently working toward my goal of gaining experience in the nonprofit sector by interning with Hopeful Change, a nonprofit partnered with Georgia Tech’s Institute of Leadership and Social Impact. In this role, I contribute to an organization that empowers underprivileged youth through mentoring, counseling, and outreach programs. As a social media marketing intern, I am honing my digital media skills and combining my passion for creative arts and business to produce engaging, aesthetically pleasing content.

In addition, my sister and I recently launched an initiative called Empower Haitian Youth, aimed at uplifting young Haitians in high school and college. In response to the recent influx of Haitian immigrants, we saw an opportunity to support our community by creating educational content to help them develop the skills necessary to launch their careers. The platform focuses on key topics such as financial aid, career development, and building a sense of community. Through this initiative, we aim to strengthen the support system within the Haitian community and contribute to its well-being by providing valuable resources and encouragement.

To further enhance my skills, I am taking courses like management statistics to improve my data analytics abilities and becoming more familiar with platforms such as Microsoft Excel. Although I have an interest in project management, I’ve struggled to fully engage with the community at my university for aspiring project managers. Since I’m less familiar with this area, I’ve found it challenging to develop this skill, but this semester, I plan to take more active steps to participate in these clubs.

When it comes to building a network of like-minded individuals, I’ve faced challenges in finding people who align with my career goal of becoming a social entrepreneur. However, I’ve come to realize that every person is unique, and even those who may not seem to align with you can offer valuable insights and contribute to the realization of your dreams. Because of this, I have connected with people from various areas of business, including accounting, finance, and information technology management, as well as those in technology-related fields.

     The Servant Leader Scholars Program offers an education enriched with workshops designed to cultivate both the skills I seek to develop and new competencies essential to my business education. Specifically, the program will help me enhance my project management abilities in a way that aligns with my interests, all through the lens of serving others. I also believe that the peers in my cohort will form a supportive community, and I will be introduced to a network of individuals who will potentially become lifelong friends.

Additionally, I understand that the program was originally created to support students from Stephenson High School. As a Stone Mountain native, Stephenson High School is my home school. Reflecting on my community, I recognize the lack of arts programs in many public high schools within Black communities. This awareness continues to fuel my desire to make a difference. Having benefited from a performing arts education, I understand the profound impact of having a creative outlet outside of academics. It provided me with opportunities for self-expression and personal growth, and I want to share that experience with others in meaningful ways.

I am deeply inspired by the program’s mission to empower underrepresented students in business and technology. Its nonprofit focus aligns with my aspiration to establish a social enterprise in the future. I believe the Servant Leader Scholars Program closely aligns with my goals and will provide the tools I need to create meaningful social change. I am eager to gain hands-on experience in serving others through this program and to acquire valuable insights into the social impact initiatives it promotes.

Additionally, I aim to build a solid foundation in the technical and leadership skills necessary to drive meaningful change in global healthcare, with a long-term vision of improving medical infrastructure in underserved communities such as those in the Congo. My motivation stems from a desire to bridge the gap between advanced medical technology and equitable healthcare access, ensuring that life-saving innovations reach those who need them most.

     My journey toward achieving my early career goals has been driven by a strong desire to apply biomedical engineering to real-world challenges and advance my technical skills. I have been actively seeking VIP (Vertically Integrated Projects) research and internship opportunities to gain practical experience and deepen my understanding of medical technology innovation. Recognizing the growing role of robotics in healthcare, I recently joined the Medical Robotics Club at my school to further my knowledge in this area as I prepare to acquire a robotics minor.

Throughout this journey, I have faced challenges in balancing my academic workload, as I am currently taking 17 credits hours, with my pursuit of extracurricular opportunities and professional development. However, these experiences have strengthened my time management and adaptability skills. I have thrived in leadership roles within various organizations, which have helped me build confidence and refine my problem-solving abilities. Despite occasional setbacks, my commitment to my career goals remains unwavering as I continue to seek opportunities that align with my passion for healthcare innovation and global equity.

     My current early career goals are centered around two main passions: playing professional basketball and becoming a software developer. I’m dedicated to training rigorously and improving my basketball skills with the ultimate goal of playing at the professional level. Basketball has always been a driving force in my life, teaching me discipline, teamwork, and resilience. These qualities motivate me to push beyond limits and pursue excellence on and off the court. At the same time, I am pursuing a degree in computer science with aspirations of becoming a software developer. Technology constantly evolves, and I’m fascinated by its ability to solve real-world problems and create innovative solutions. This field offers endless opportunities to learn and grow, allowing me to combine creativity and logic. Balancing both paths requires hard work and commitment, but I’m motivated by the challenge of turning my passions into successful, fulfilling careers.

     My journey toward achieving my early career goals in professional basketball and software development has been a blend of challenges, growth, and resilience. On the basketball side, I’ve dedicated countless hours to training, improving my skills, and staying physically and mentally prepared. However, balancing intense training with academic responsibilities hasn’t always been easy. There were moments when managing both felt overwhelming, and I had to learn better time management and self-discipline to stay on track. Pursuing computer science has also come with its struggles. Some concepts, especially in programming and problem-solving, were initially difficult to grasp. I had to adapt by seeking extra help, using online resources, and practicing consistently to improve. Despite these challenges, I’ve thrived by staying committed and embracing setbacks as learning opportunities. Every obstacle has pushed me to become stronger, more adaptable, and more determined to achieve success in both basketball and technology.

     My current early career goal is to establish a strong foundation in human resources, focusing on fostering equitable and inclusive workplace cultures. I aim to gain experience in key HR areas such as talent acquisition, employee engagement, diversity and inclusion initiatives, and organizational development. My long-term vision is to become an HR leader who drives meaningful change by creating environments where employees feel valued, supported, and empowered to reach their full potential.

This goal is motivated by my passion for helping people and my own experiences navigating challenges as the child of immigrants and a leader in my community. My work with the Black Affairs Council and other student organizations has shown me the importance of building systems that support individuals while fostering collaboration and growth. I’m inspired by the opportunity to bridge the gap between organizational goals and employee well-being, contributing to workplaces that thrive on mutual respect and shared purpose.

    <td>
     My journey toward a career in human resources has been shaped by a combination of challenges, pivots, and moments of growth that have clarified my purpose and goals.  

Initially, I pursued a biology major with a business minor, envisioning a path in healthcare. However, I realized my interests lay more in working with people and shaping organizational cultures rather than following a purely scientific track. This led me to pivot and focus fully on business, which allowed me to explore areas like leadership, organizational development, and community engagement—fields that align closely with human resources.  

I’ve thrived in leadership roles, such as serving as the Freshman Advisory Board advisor for the Black Affairs Council at UGA, where I developed skills in recruiting, mentoring, and organizing impactful programs. This experience showed me the value of creating environments where individuals feel seen, supported, and empowered, which is at the heart of HR work. I’ve also successfully planned large-scale events, managed diverse teams, and cultivated relationships with various stakeholders, all of which have strengthened my confidence in my ability to lead and manage people.  

At the same time, I’ve faced struggles. Balancing academics, extracurriculars, and personal challenges, such as managing my autoimmune disease and dealing with a breakup, has tested my resilience. I’ve also wrestled with self-doubt and anxiety during transitions, such as switching my major and rethinking my career aspirations. However, these struggles have taught me the importance of adaptability, self-reflection, and seeking support from mentors and loved ones.  

Each step of my journey has reinforced my commitment to pursuing a career in human resources, where I can use my skills and experiences to positively impact others’ lives. Moving forward, I’m excited to continue gaining experience, building my expertise, and contributing to organizations that value people as their most important asset.

     Participating in the Servant Leader Scholars (SLS) program would be an invaluable opportunity to further my early career goals in human resources. The program’s focus on leadership development through service aligns with my belief that strong leadership is rooted in empathy, collaboration, and making a positive impact on others—values that are core to effective HR work.

The mentorship and networking opportunities within the SLS program would allow me to connect with experienced leaders who can guide me in navigating the challenges of my career path. Their insights on topics like inclusive leadership, conflict resolution, and team development would be particularly beneficial as I aim to build expertise in managing people and fostering organizational cultures that prioritize employee well-being. 

Additionally, the program’s emphasis on service aligns with my passion for community engagement. As someone who has worked with organizations like the Black Affairs Council at UGA, I understand the importance of creating environments where individuals feel supported, heard, and empowered. The SLS program would give me practical tools to develop these skills further and apply them in an HR context, where the well-being of individuals is directly linked to the success of an organization.

Lastly, the program would help me cultivate the self-awareness and resilience necessary for overcoming the inevitable challenges I will face in HR. Through service-oriented leadership, I would gain a deeper understanding of the value of adaptability, accountability, and the importance of empowering others—key qualities for an HR professional.

I’m confident that the experience, connections, and leadership skills I would gain through SLS would directly support my goal of becoming a human resources leader who champions the growth and success of both employees and organizations.

     My early career goals revolve around developing expertise in data engineering, data analysis, and product management while gaining a deeper understanding of the business side of technology.

My focus is on mastering tools and techniques for data processing, predictive analytics, and system optimization, with the ultimate goal of bridging the gap between technical solutions and business strategies.

This ambition is driven by my fascination with how data can solve complex problems, reveal trends, and unlock new opportunities. Whether analyzing performance metrics in sports or forecasting market trends in business, I am motivated by the potential to create meaningful change through data.

In addition to hands-on experience, I plan to further my education through advanced coursework or certifications in data science, machine learning, and business strategy. These steps will prepare me to take on roles where I can drive impactful decisions, contribute to organizational growth, and advance my career in the rapidly evolving tech landscape.

     My journey toward achieving my early career goals has been marked by growth, challenges, and pivotal moments. As a sophomore majoring in Data and Computer Sciences at the University of Georgia, I’ve immersed myself in academic and extracurricular activities to sharpen my technical skills. Projects like developing a Tic-Tac-Toe game with AI and building a Java-based Connect Four game have strengthened my problem-solving abilities and reinforced my passion for creating functional solutions.

However, the path hasn’t been without struggles. Retaking challenging courses like Calculus and Software Development has taught me the importance of resilience and discipline. These experiences have motivated me to refine my study habits and focus on consistency.

Through internships and leadership roles, I’ve also pivoted toward exploring data engineering and product management. I’ve thrived in roles requiring collaboration, such as organizing coding competitions and hackathons, which sharpened my teamwork and project management skills. Each step of this journey has brought me closer to my career aspirations, teaching me that persistence and adaptability are key to success.

     Participation in the Servant Leader Scholars (SLS) program would significantly help me achieve my early career goals by providing opportunities to grow as a leader while making a meaningful impact on my community. The program's emphasis on service and leadership aligns closely with my aspiration to bridge technical expertise with social responsibility. I believe that creating impactful solutions goes beyond technical skills—it requires empathy, collaboration, and a commitment to addressing real-world challenges.

Through SLS, I would gain valuable leadership experience by working on service projects that allow me to apply my data engineering and analysis skills in ways that directly benefit others. Collaborating with other like-minded scholars and mentors would expand my perspective, help me develop innovative problem-solving strategies, and refine my ability to communicate complex ideas to diverse audiences.

      Early Career Goals: Define your current early career goals and your motivation for establishing them. (150 word minimum):

    </td>
    <td>
     My current early career goals focus on building the professional and technical skills necessary to excel in finance, ultimately securing a role in wealth management upon graduating college. These ambitions were not always my focus; when I began college, I lacked clarity about my career path. However, through trial and error, self-reflection, and perseverance, I discovered my passion for finance. This journey has fueled my motivation, as I’ve learned to embrace setbacks and failures as opportunities for growth. Each challenge has strengthened my resolve and equipped me with the determination to stay on course toward my goals.

I take pride in holding myself accountable, using every experience—whether a success or a stumble—as a stepping stone. My family and mentors have been instrumental in shaping my confidence and resilience, providing unwavering support and encouragement. Their guidance inspires me to continue striving toward excellence and embody the values of servant leadership in my personal and professional life.

     My journey has been one of growth, transformation, and resilience. It began with uncertainty, fear, and frustration, but I’ve turned those emotions into strengths of confidence, passion, and humility. Early in my college career, I struggled with behavioral interviews and felt unprepared to connect with others on a professional level. When faced with technical finance questions, my lack of confidence often held me back from delivering strong responses. However, meeting my mentors marked a turning point. Through their guidance, I gained valuable interpersonal skills and practiced interviews, allowing me to feel more comfortable and self-assured in professional settings.

I’ve also learned the importance of stepping outside my comfort zone and embracing challenges. Taking constructive criticism was once difficult for me, but I’ve come to see it as an essential skill that has greatly enhanced my personal and professional growth. Today, I view failures as opportunities to pivot, adapt, and thrive, each one shaping me into a stronger and more capable individual. While my journey is far from over, it has taught me who I am and clarified the professional I aspire to become. This ongoing process of growth is what drives me to continue striving for excellence.

     My journey toward my early career goals has had its ups and downs so far. Initially, I pursued a biology major with the goal of becoming an orthopedic surgeon, driven by my passion for science, sports and helping others. However, over time, I found myself drawn to the intersection of policy, law, and society, which led me to pivot toward political science. My decision was influence by my desire to influence change on a larger scale and address the systemic issues that impact my community. The transition was a bit difficult, especially in adapting to the different way of thinking required for political science. I had to develop strong analytical skills, engage with many readings, and understand the complexity of policy and law. Despite these challenges, I thrived by finding my passion and figuring out how government and business can work together to solve societal problems. The change has given me new direction, new purpose and I’m excited to build upon my experiences as I work toward a career in corporate law.

One notable obstacle I’ve faced is being rejected at job fairs and when applying to internships due to being a freshman, despite my academic standing being one year ahead of my physical year. While these rejections have been discouraging, I view them as learning opportunities. I prioritize attending every job fair I can, using each experience to improve my networking skills, gain exposure to the professional world, and refine how I present myself to potential employers.

To build practical experience, I proactively reached out to a mentor who runs a startup and joined his team as a digital marketing fellow. This role has allowed me to develop analytics skills while collaborating on impactful projects with a team. These experiences have strengthened my resilience and adaptability, motivating me to keep pursuing my career goals.

     My goal is to build a solid foundation in supply chain management, focusing on logistics and operations. Through experiences like my internship at Emory NextGen and my work with  Michel's Trucking, I’ve learned the importance of optimizing processes to enhance efficiency. Additionally, my background as a first-generation student and my desire to build a career that allows me to contribute to my community motivates me to pursue a career where I can make a tangible impact. I’m motivated by my desire to contribute to my community by improving systems that provide resources and create opportunities. In the long run, I aim to take on a leadership role where I can mentor others and shape the future of business management, especially in underserved communities.

    </td>
    <td>
     As a first-generation student, my journey toward achieving my career goals in supply chain management has been one of self-reliance and discovery. Unlike many of my peers, I did not have the advantage of parents who could guide me through the college process or offer advice on what career path to pursue. This lack of direction created uncertainty when choosing a major and navigating the academic landscape.

I struggled with figuring out where my strengths aligned with career opportunities, and I often felt unsure about the decisions I was making. However, this challenge became a driving force for me to seek out mentorship from professors, attend career fairs, and engage in extracurricular activities that could provide insight into different fields. Through these experiences, I discovered my passion for supply chain management and developed a clearer vision for my future. As I continue to grow, I remain focused on expanding my knowledge and gaining hands-on experience to achieve my goals in this field.

     My early career journey has been a mix of dedication, growth, and resilience as I work toward my goals in healthcare and beyond. Studying integrated health science at Kennesaw State University has laid a strong foundation for my future in nursing. While navigating challenging courses, I’ve demonstrated determination and adaptability, giving despite the rigorous demand of my pre-requisites. I’ve also gained valuable experience through leadership roles, such as volunteering in the Teen Experience Leadership Program and working with KSU Housing’s Hootcrew. These opportunities have allowed me to strengthen my communication, organization, and problem solving skills. Balancing academics, work, and personal commitments has been a challenge, but I’ve grown by setting clear boundaries and prioritizing my goals. Each step of this journey has taught me perseverance and focus, helping me stay on track toward becoming a nurse and one day opening my own Med Spa.

    <td>
     My current early career goals are to utilize the many resources available to me on campus to start developing technical skills. While gaining these technical skills, I hope to learn valuable soft skills that will allow me to secure an internship the summer before my junior year of college. I'm motivated by the idea of making an impact. I've always had a passion for flight, so through aerospace engineering I can design things that have lasting beneficial effects long after I am gone. Using the knowledge I hope to gain, I want to design new forms of transportation that help connect the world and avoid leaving a lasting negative impact on the environment. I'm also motivated by my family. My father served in the military, and my mother worked in education. They devoted their lives to pouring into and protecting others, and I feel the best use of my abilities is giving back through engineering.

     My journey toward establishing my early career goals has been rooted in working as hard as I can in whatever I'm doing. The point I struggled the most was when I was originally deferred from Georgia Tech. It was my top school and derailed my entire college plan. However, I remained steadfast and not only increased my GPA but also managed to finish in the top ten of my class. Since being on campus, I’ve dived into campus organizations and secured leadership roles. I found a passion for designing events that connect people and help them develop their skills, whether through planning social or professional events. I've been able to refine my skills as I transitioned into this next chapter of my life. I've also made connections with upperclassmen and graduates in my major to learn from their experiences and apply their lessons to my own journey. Through SLS I hope to keep being able to make meaningful connections to further my development.

     After connecting with students like Jaila who have gone through SLS and partnering with SLS for an LDR event, I have been able to see the impact it has on students.

I believe SLS can help me develop the skills needed for my early career journey. Furthermore, it will surround me with like-minded individuals who will push me to be a better version of myself every day.

     My current early career goal is to become a financial analyst while simultaneously working on gaining my Bachelor’s degree (BA), pursuing an MBA, and completing esthetician school. I have always been passionate about finance and business, and I believe that becoming a financial analyst will allow me to combine my analytical skills with my desire to help businesses make sound financial decisions. By obtaining my BA and MBA, I will strengthen my business acumen and increase my qualifications for more advanced roles in finance.

Additionally, I am already investing in myself and my business, as I currently own a lash business. This entrepreneurial experience has given me a practical understanding of business operations and financial management. By completing esthetician school, I aim to further develop my skills in the beauty industry, which ties into my current business. These combined efforts will give me a well-rounded foundation, both in finance and entrepreneurship, and will enable me to grow in multiple areas of interest.

     My journey toward achieving my early career goals has been a mix of challenges, growth, and determination. Starting at a young age, I knew that I wanted to pursue multiple goals, including becoming a financial analyst, obtaining my degrees, and growing my lash business. However, one of the biggest struggles I faced was the challenge of investing in myself. As a young person, it was difficult to navigate the financial responsibilities of both furthering my education and starting a business.

To overcome this, I took the initiative to secure a job that would allow me to save and build the capital necessary to launch my business. This job has not only helped me save but also taught me valuable time management and financial skills that have been crucial as I balance work, school, and entrepreneurship. Though the path hasn’t always been easy, I’ve thrived by staying focused on my goals and pushing through the obstacles, knowing that each step I take brings me closer to my dreams.

The program's emphasis on service-oriented leadership would give me a solid foundation in moral decision-making, teamwork, and community involvement as I strive to become an analyst in finance, earn my MBA, and expand my lash business.

The tenets of servant leadership place a significant emphasis on listening, empathy, and prioritizing the needs of others—qualities that are critical for establishing solid, trustworthy connections in both my business and the corporate world.

     My early career goals have been basic training in the medical world. These goals came from high school, and I'm still establishing them through my college career. Some goals like certifications are important to me, and I have already accomplished some with my basic life support certification I earned in high school. Other goals were simply academic like having over a 3.0 gpa in my first semester of college which I have also already achieved. Another goal that was very important to me was getting into the Pre-Nursing Society at my school, as it provides lots of opportunities curated to my major. The program also enabled me to create more goals, like a ACLS and PALS certification. I am always motivated by the fact that these goals will one day lead me to my dream career in healthcare. I know and understand that obtaining the goals early in my career will lead to bigger and better goals in the future. My motivation for my future career will lead me to create, and achieve many more career oriented goals. And while I'm still working toward some of these goals, I know I will be able to achieve them.

     My journey to achieving my early goals have been the basic trials and tribulations that we all face. As I was trying to achieve my goal of getting BLS certified in high school, I had troubles falling behind and keeping up with the steps of basic life support. In order for me to combat these goals I had to learn how to balance my time, while also taking time to learn the steps of basic life support as I knew this certification was not something I could take lightly. Earning over a 3.0 gpa in college was very challenging, learning how to balance classes, being on time, and taking the time to learn new materials was quite overwhelming at first. Once I got into a good rhythm with going to classes, teaching myself information along with my professors guidance, and creating work-life balance, everything came together for me to be a successful student. PNS was the best resource given to me as they gave me resources to study, and a community to go to. I would go as far to say the pre nursing society was my asset to help me achieve my early goals in college. The journey toward reaching your goals won't always be smooth, but there are ways to combat your troubles.

Being in SLS would bring me skills that I would use in my everyday career, and it would also bring me the grand opportunity to freshen up the skills I already have like public speaking. While being in SLS I would also have the chance to be around like minded students who are also interested into gaining professional skills. Being admitted into this program will help pay for a portion of my education, which eventually would further my career. Being a leader in SLS would better me professionally in many ways, and could be a life changing resource to me.

     My current early career goals revolve around using my passion for technology and programming to make a lasting impact on both my community and the broader world. Since I was young, I’ve been fascinated by coding and exploring innovative ways to use technology for good. A significant motivation behind my career aspirations is the desire to create solutions that improve lives, such as developing software in the medical field or enhancing accessibility for people with disabilities.
One of my key projects, a web extension designed to help people with visual impairments read text online more easily, embodies this mission. This initiative earned me a finalist position in my district's Congressional App Challenge, awarded by Congressman David Scott, and reinforced my commitment to leveraging technology for meaningful change.
Looking ahead, I aim to pursue a career as a software engineer. This role will enable me to explore various facets of computer science, from designing algorithms that enhance user experiences to contributing to advancements in cybersecurity that protect users' data. I also aspire to mentor underrepresented students in STEM, inspiring the next generation of innovators.
My time at university will not simply be about earning a computer science degree. It will be an opportunity to acquire the knowledge, skills, and collaborative experience necessary to sow the seeds of my long-term goal: positively impacting the world through technology.

     I can vividly remember the day my family bought our first computer, shared among the six of us. This device became my portal to captivating video games, and I would eagerly await my turn. In elementary school, my curiosity about how these games worked led me to explore the mechanisms behind them. I began learning block coding through an online platform called Scratch. I spent hours experimenting with the code until I successfully created my first project, a racing game. Though simple, this project laid the foundation for my programming skills and sparked a deep interest in coding.
However, when I entered high school, I encountered a challenge: the computer science classes I hoped to take were no longer offered. Growing up in a low-income, underserved school district, this lack of access to formal education in technology didn’t deter me. Instead, I self-taught coding and learned programming languages like Python and JavaScript. It was difficult at times, but the process of problem-solving and overcoming challenges fueled my passion even further.
This drive led me to create Foodle, a game that, at its peak, had 100,000 users per day and was featured in several online publications, including the New York Post. Most recently, I developed a Chrome extension to improve online reading for individuals with visual impairments. Despite not having traditional access to computer science education, my dedication to learning and my love for technology have guided me toward achieving my career goals.

      Early Career Goals: Define your current early career goals and your motivation for establishing them. (150 word minimum):

    </td>
    <td>
     From a young age, I found myself enchanted by technology's endless possibilities and unique capabilities. As I grew older, my desire to explore technology only grew stronger as I developed a passion for programming that pushed me towards wanting to explore the subject further by majoring in computer science. With my growth in age came a loss of a level of ignorance regarding the difficulty women who look like me experience in the software development and computer science sector. Only 22% of the Software Development field consists of women, and only 3% of those women are black. Upon learning these devastating statistics, I was disappointed as I learned that the field I grew to love so much did not include or represent individuals who look like me. Rather than viewing this as a point of discouragement or feeling of inefficiency, I used this as an encouragement to pursue the field and motivate other young girls who look like me to envision themselves in the computer science field. This serves as my primary goal as I embark on my journey of being a software developer. 

	I plan to use my passion to transform the world positively into a better place for more female and black software engineers. I plan to work to lead by example for young girls and represent what it means to be a successful black woman in the field of computer science. This will be influential in the lives of many, as I genuinely wish I had seen more women who looked like me in this field when I was growing up. I plan to do this by potentially starting a non profit organization where girls can come to learn programming and robotics in order to discover their passions within the technology sector. This is similar to the work I have already been doing within my church youth group as I served as a teen mentor in the programming classes that my church offered for kids.  In a world learning and adjusting to the growth of artificial intelligence, ethical programming is imperative as all users must be prioritized in creating products catered to them. In the future, I have set the long-term goal of working to create ethical programs that cater to user experience. I will not simply see the users of the software I create as a paycheck but as people with individual lives and values that matter. I feel that the current state of the technology sector does not prioritize user satisfaction, and that is extremely evident in the mental health issues and bullying that have been caused by social media software. It is my goal to ensure that all the work I produce is ethical and useful for all individuals, regardless of what their background may be.

	My goal is not to merely be in the software development field but to transform it. I hope to use my knowledge an expertise to become a software developer at a company who later shifts into a field of project management and entrepreneurship. Participation in the Servant Leaders Scholar program would provide me with several beneficial resources to explore both the technology and business fields in order to allow me to efficiently pursue my goals.

     Throughout my career journey thus far, I have been blessed enough to gain exposure to various opportunities that have shaped me professionally into the person I am today. From my early internships at Academic Haven and Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab to personal projects and leadership roles, each experience has uniquely contributed to my growth.

My first technical internship was at Academic Haven, where I worked with HTML, CSS, and React to build educational tools. It was my first time applying my programming knowledge to real-world projects, and I thrived in an environment that pushed me to think critically and collaborate with a team. This experience strengthened my passion for front-end development and motivated me to explore more complex technologies.
That curiosity led me to an internship at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab, where I gained hands-on experience. While I was excited to work in a professional setting, I initially struggled with imposter syndrome, doubting whether I truly belonged in a space filled with experienced engineers. But rather than letting those doubts hold me back, I leaned into my community, sought guidance, and reminded myself that every expert was once a beginner. That shift in mindset helped me approach challenges with confidence and reinforced my ability to grow in technical environments.

At Georgia Tech, I’ve expanded my learning even further by working on projects that blend my technical skills with my leadership background. Through my involvement in clubs and organizations, as well as class projects, I’ve had the opportunity to collaborate with diverse teams, tackle real-world problems, and apply my knowledge in meaningful ways. Whether it’s leading initiatives that foster inclusivity, developing applications that enhance user experience, or contributing to group projects that challenge my problem-solving abilities, these experiences have reinforced my passion for both technology and community-building.
However, one of the biggest pivots in my journey has been shifting my mindset from simply seeking knowledge to actively building a network and mentoring others. As someone who didn’t always see many people who looked like me in tech spaces, I’ve aimed to inspire and uplift other young girls interested in computer science. With this goal, one of my biggest focuses is finding ways to give back to generations coming after me by pushing young black girls around me to explore the technology industry.

I am eager to continue growing as a developer and leader, taking on new challenges, and contributing to spaces that empower the next generation of the technology industry. My journey is just beginning, but every challenge, pivot, and success has only strengthened my passion for this field and my commitment to making an impact.

     My participation in the Servant Leader Scholars program would provide me with the mentorship, community, and leadership development necessary to propel me toward my early career goals. As an aspiring software developer, I recognize that technical skills alone are not enough to build a fulfilling and impactful career leadership, service, and a strong support system are just as crucial.

Speaking with several members of the SLS leadership at a roundtable event was a pivotal moment for me. The kindness, wisdom, and genuine investment in the success that I experienced, even if the brief conversations I had, left a lasting impression and made me eager to immerse myself in this community. It was clear that SLS is not just about career advancement but about shaping people who uplift those around them while striving for excellence in their own pursuits.

Throughout my journey, I have sought out opportunities that blend leadership and technical growth. I have always been drawn to spaces where I can both learn and give back. SLS embodies that same spirit of service, providing a platform where I can refine my leadership skills while being surrounded by like-minded individuals who are passionate about making a difference.

This program would allow me to further develop as a leader while equipping me with the tools and network to thrive in my career. More importantly, it would position me to continue the mentorship cycle, ensuring that I, too, can one day assist others like SLS could assist me.

      Early Career Goals: Define your current early career goals and your motivation for establishing them. (150 word minimum):

    <td>
     My fascination with coding began in my early childhood when I discovered Roblox, a video game that attracted my curiosity about game development. I soon delved into learning Lua, the programming language behind Roblox games during middle school. Collaborating with friends from middle school, we spent countless hours trying to perfect our game. In the process, we were honing invaluable skills such as problem-solving and teamwork, which is very important in the realm of computer science.

Eager to deepen my understanding, I enrolled in computer science classes in high school, where I grasped the fundamentals of Java and dabbled in data structures. Outside the classroom, I ventured into UI Design using Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator, and dug myself into a tunnel full of opportunities.

As I continue my career path, I realize that my motivation lies in my curiosity. I am always eager to learn more, and that is one of the main reasons why I am applying to this program. My current career goals are to become a successful software engineer and provide technologies that can help underrepresented communities. I say that because I have always involved myself with helping my community, whether that be through service-led initiatives or programs. In that, I have found that computer science has the power to make a change, and I want to leverage its abilities to help my surrounding communities and make an impact wherever I go.

     My journey to achieving my early career goals has been involved with perseverance and learning how to adapt in both technical and personal dimensions. Balancing my academic pursuits in Computer Science with leadership roles like Community Service Chair for the Black Male Leadership Society and being on the Equity Engineer Council has taught me the importance of resilience and time management. Time management has been the most crucial aspect of my life that has helped me pivot my struggles. Committing specific parts of my day to study, relax, and eat accordingly has led me to build long-lasting habits that are applicable everywhere I go. 
Financial struggles within my family have also challenged my ability to fully focus on school, but they’ve also fueled my determination to excel. Through careful planning and a commitment to building strong habits, I’ve maintained a high level of academic performance while engaging in impactful extracurricular activities, such as my role as a GAAME Ambassador and my participation in NASA L’SPACE NPWEE.
My developed faith in Jesus Christ has also been a cornerstone of my journey, providing purpose and clarity during difficult times. With every step, I’ve learned that challenges can shape and sharpen our resolve, basically bringing me closer to my dreams.

     As I approach the end of my sophomore year at Spelman College, I have career goals that I am very set on. I aim to attend the USC Chan Division of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy and enter their Entry-Level Doctorate of Occupational Therapy (OTD) program after I graduate in 2027.  This program aligns with my aspirations to become a licensed occupational therapist who works in pediatrics. I want to help them establish independence and improve their quality of life. Additionally, my motivation stems from the experiences of my older brother and his journey with autism. My interest in occupational therapy was sparked by seeing the difficulties he encountered and the profound impact the therapies had on his growth. I want to give children and their families the resources and encouragement they require to navigate similar experiences. Inspired by his experiences, I am passionate about providing children and their families with the resources and encouragement needed to overcome similar obstacles and thrive.

    <td>
     In my journey, working toward achieving my early career goals has been both fulfilling and challenging. During my first year at Spelman, I struggled with imposter syndrome, often questioning whether I truly belonged in such a prestigious environment. However, I learned to confront those doubts by leaning on my faith, seeking mentorship, and building a supportive community. This experience helped me develop resilience and confidence in my abilities, enabling me to excel academically and personally.

Despite my initial struggles, I’ve thrived in several key areas. Shadowing physical therapists reinforced my passion for rehabilitation and taught me the value of patience and adaptability. My volunteer work, particularly with organizations like Agape Family and Youth Center, provided me with firsthand experience in supporting diverse communities and improving accessibility.

While securing occupational therapy-specific internships has been a challenge, I’ve pivoted by expanding my skill set through leadership roles in GRL PWR and community engagement initiatives. These experiences have fueled my determination to succeed and affirmed my passion for pursuing pediatric occupational therapy.

     Participating in the Servant Leader Scholars program would provide an invaluable opportunity to align my passion for uplifting marginalized communities with my early career goals in rehabilitation and mentoring. The program's focus on servant leadership resonates deeply with my values, shaped by my experiences. These roles have taught me the importance of fostering mutual growth, which I believe is the essence of servant leadership.

By engaging in the program, I would gain access to a network of like-minded individuals, practical leadership training, and mentorship opportunities that would enhance my ability to serve others effectively. This foundation would directly support my aspiration to become a leader in pediatric therapy and community advocacy, empowering young people, particularly girls of color, to embrace their strengths and overcome societal barriers.

Ultimately, the Servant Leader Scholars program would equip me with the skills and perspective necessary to turn my vision of transformative impact into a reality, bridging my academic background in dance, anthropology, and movement analysis with meaningful service to others.

    <td>
     My top career goals are to drive innovation in marketing and management, uplift underrepresented communities, and continuously learn throughout my career. These ambitions stem from personal challenges I once thought I couldn’t overcome. Having navigated those obstacles, I developed an unwavering desire to give back—particularly to minority communities—by providing access to the knowledge I wish I had earlier. In my search for an organization that aligns with these values, Google stood out. While many view Google as simply a search engine, I see it as a gateway to knowledge, connection, and opportunity. The vast resources Google provides can empower individuals to transform their futures—if they know how to access and utilize them. For many first-generation and immigrant families, this awareness is lacking. Learned helplessness is common, as education is often perceived as a burden rather than an opportunity. The National Center for Education Statistics reports that only 21% of Hispanics are enrolled in degree-granting institutions. This reflects a greater issue: the lack of awareness of available resources, such as scholarships, networking, and career guidance. I hope to bridge this gap by working at Google in marketing/management, helping underserved communities recognize the opportunities at their fingertips. I often wonder how my parents' lives might have been different had they understood the power of the internet earlier. Through my work, I want to ensure others don’t miss these opportunities. The first step toward success is seeking knowledge—and that journey often begins with a single search.

As a child, I struggled with the rigid structure of the classroom—the expectation for silence, uniformity, and minimal creativity. It felt suffocating. This frustration followed me into middle school, where I was a consistent B and C student, despite my best efforts. My parents, hoping to push me forward, instead pushed me further away. I was labeled lazy, unfocused, and indifferent—but I knew that wasn’t true. It felt like I was running with weights on my back while everyone else ran free. Everything changed in junior year of high school when I was diagnosed with ADHD. Suddenly, I realized I wasn’t the person others had described—I was creative, determined, and capable. My struggles weren’t from a lack of effort but from unrecognized challenges. This diagnosis reshaped my perspective, helping me see that my path to success wouldn’t be traditional, but it was still mine to carve. Despite this revelation, I wrestled with the plague of possibility—wondering how much further I could have gone if I had known earlier. But instead of dwelling on the past, I’ve embraced the endless opportunities of the future. This mindset became even stronger after my dyslexia diagnosis. As someone who loves writing, it was a shock—but instead of seeing it as a setback, I educated myself on how to adapt and thrive. These experiences have shaped my approach to both life and career. I’ve learned that success isn’t about following a perfect path—it’s about adapting, pushing forward, and embracing who you are. Now, I see my challenges not as obstacles but as tools to help others navigate their own journeys. My passion for marketing and community impact is fueled by this understanding, and I am determined to use my story to help others see their own potential, no matter the barriers they face.

      How Can SLS Help?: How do you feel your participation in the Servant Leader Scholars program would help you achieve your early career goals?

    </td>
    <td>
     The moment I heard about the Servant Leader Scholars program, I knew I had to apply. As a first-generation college student, navigating higher education has been both exciting and overwhelming. One of my biggest concerns was finding guidance—I didn’t know what college truly entailed, let alone how to connect with people who could help me grow academically and professionally. This program represents the mentorship, support, and structured growth I have been searching for. Beyond guidance, I want to be seen as a competitive high-achieving student. However, I believe that true competitiveness isn’t just about saying you’re ambitious—it’s about constantly evolving and proving your value through action. As a Hispanic and Black woman, I understand that sometimes previously made biases exist, but I also know that demonstrating excellence transcends stereotypes. By participating in this program, I hope to refine my skills, build a strong professional network, and gain the tools needed to elevate myself beyond expectations. Ultimately, I am passionate about making a difference—both in my career and in the communities that shaped me. If given the opportunity, I would use the Servant Leader Scholars program as a platform to develop my leadership abilities, expand my portfolio, and build connections that will help me inspire others. I believe this program could play a critical role in helping me achieve my early career goals while also positioning me to uplift those who come after me.

     My early career goals are centered around combining a dual MS/MPH degree post grad to integrate advanced engineering solutions with public health strategies in order to develop innovative, accessible medical solutions that address health disparities. By pursuing an MPH after my undergraduate degree, I aim to specialize in epidemiology and healthcare technology management, allowing me to translate the gap between engineering advancements and equitable healthcare deliverable systems. 
	This vision is driven by my passion for and genuine desire to address systemic issues that prevent underserved communities from accessing life-saving technologies. During my internship in Valencia, Spain, I witnessed how research in cancer detection can lead to transformative health outcomes, further inspiring me to work on projects that integrate engineering innovation with public health strategies. My ultimate goal is to work in government, focusing on policy-driven innovation in public health technology and systems, ensuring equitable access to resources for underserved communities.

    <td>
     My journey toward achieving my early career goals has been a dynamic blend of academic growth, personal reflection and hands-on experience. Majoring in Biological/Bioengineering has provided me with a strong technical foundation, while my minor in Spanish and study abroad internship in Valencia, Spain, enhanced my cultural awareness and adaptability. Working on melanoma detecting research during this internship helped me hone skills in RNA extraction, Western blotting, and cell culture, solidifying my passion for healthcare innovation. 
        However, the path hasn’t been without challenges. Navigating the rigorous demands of my engineering curriculum while staying active in clubs like SHPE and NSBE required significant time management and prioritization. Initially, I struggled to balance academics, extracurriculars, and personal well-being, but this struggle taught me resilience and how to lean on my support network. Thriving in collaborative spaces, I’ve been privileged to pivot my focus on passions and career aspirations through exposure to mentorship opportunities and interdisciplinary projects that address real-world healthcare challenges. These experiences have prepared me to integrate my technical expertise with public health strategies to create innovative, accessible medical solutions.

     In my early career, I would love to gain exposure to the technology workforce, getting to intern at companies who specialize in technology or cybersecurity. Some companies I would like to work with include Google, Microsoft, AT&amp;T. As I am currently exploring possible careers in the realm of technology, my primary goal is to expose myself to the environment first hand. Although I am not entirely sure of my specific career path, my goal is to build my experience in the field through building a network of experienced individuals who have careers in areas like cybersecurity and data analysis. After building my network, and gaining experience through internships, I hope to find a sustainable career working for one of the companies mentioned before, and ideally after my job experience, I can begin my own practice in cybersecurity or another field of choice. The motivation for this is to expose myself as much as possible to the broad field of technology, which is interesting to me as someone who has grown up with technology that has evolved immensely in my lifetime. As technology has become an inseparable force in our lives, I’d like to understand how we can use it to build a safe, yet advanced tool for people to use, especially as tools as powerful as AI are making a controversial yet undeniable transition into our lives.

     I am relatively early in my journey, as I have recently declared my college major as MIS. I currently have a certification in Excel and am taking courses including, Accounting, Economics, and Introduction to Management Information Systems. These classes have helped me learn how to think like a businesswoman, helping establish the foundation for a potential career. However, throughout my early college experience I've struggled with deciding on a career or path. For example, coming into college, I declared my major as civil engineering, then switched to architecture, and finally I decided to pursue MIS. However, I lack exposure to what it's like to work in technology, which I think would help me understand the field a bit more. Now that I am finally taking classes in the realm of MIS, it has been a struggle for me to adapt and understand certain concepts at the same rate as some of my counterparts, however I enjoy taking the time to learn concepts on my own accord which has built my dedication and capacity for learning.

Through this, I can have deeper knowledge of my major, and what a potential career in areas like cybersecurity or data analysis actually look like from a first hand perspective. This would help me to be more confident about my future in this field.

     My early career goals include implanting myself in a field, mastering that craft, and moving into a leadership position within that field. My motivation for this goal is because I aspire to lead other smart and driven people. However, I believe that leadership is an accomplishment that is earned through doing what you are asking of your team. Through my past experience pitching for several high-level softball teams. I have learned that leadership is not respected until it is earned. If your team has not seen you putting in the time and struggle necessary, then they will not respect your leadership when it is handed to you. So, once I am in a desired field, I will make connections within my organization and lay the groundwork necessary to succeed. After that work has been done, I want to become a leader, so that I can lead several successful teams through example, compassion, and understanding.

     My journey to achieving my goals has been difficult but necessary for my growth. As I stated earlier, I aim to put in the work necessary so that I am confident that my accomplishments are earned through merit instead of being handed to me. A lot of that work is intense rigor or struggling to balance my new social life with trying to accomplish my goals. Before and while attending Georgia Tech, I have talked to several alumni who are on the other side of the journey that I am embarking on. Every time, they have told me that Georgia Tech is a very difficult university. However, anyone who has made it to the other side can make it through anything they set their mind to. Those responses assured me that it is not only normal to struggle, but it is necessary to struggle. Through that struggle, I will become self-reliant on my ability to find a way through any difficult task.

    <td>
     Participating in the Servant Leader Scholars program will help me by introducing me to an entirely new community of young driven black people who are on the same journey as me. The journey through college is very difficult, and it is one that is almost impossible if you do not have a support network. I have learned that through personal experience. I met many people early on in college, but I struggled to make deep connections with people. That is because I closed myself off from people by doing work by myself and neglecting to reach out to my friends. This series of events lead me to becoming very lonely and questioning if the journey I was on was worth it. When I reached back out to my friends that I made, I became much closer to them and gained more meaning behind what I was doing. The main aspect of the Servant Leader Scholars program that excites me is meeting new people from all around, and building a stronger community will help me feel supported and support other people on their college journey.

    <td>
     As of right now, my career goal is to land a role where I can have a mix of marketing and technology, whether that be in consulting or product management. I like problem-solving and knowing how things work, but I have always had an affinity for the creative side of businesses. Learning marketing has helped me understand how brands grow and connect with their consumers. I envision myself collaborating with others who provide unique perspectives to produce creative and unique solutions to business challenges, and I believe being a consultant, where I can help businesses optimize their strategies and/or product manager, building and refining products that meet real customer needs, really fits that role for me. I can see myself taking on these challenges when I am older and combining my knowledge in marketing and technology. As I continue to gain experience, I am excited to continue refining my skills and go into a role that aligns with my passion for business and technology.

     My journey to achieving my early career goals was very straightforward until I started college. Early in high school, I started focusing on computer science and planned my club's activities and my future plans all around computer science. I enjoyed learning it, but college taught me that while I am interested in computer science, it was not my true passion. I realized I couldn't completely ignore my passion for business to pursue a degree I would not thrive with (computer science). The realization really changed my world because my interests in business and marketing were not new; it was just not something I thought I would go after full time. I started my pivot into business by changing my major and joining more business-centered clubs, such as Diversity in Business. Being involved in student organizations such as Diversity in Business has given me the opportunity to work in teams to take on real-world business problems. Even though I've made almost a 180 in what I plan on pursuing and learned that life does not always go the way you plan, I look forward to learning more and thriving with my business degree to eventually become a consultant and/or product manager.

     Being part of servant leader scholars is something I look forward to because I believe being part of servant leader scholars will help me grow in ways I cannot imagine. From the roundtable discussion held at Georgia Tech with people from Servant Leaders, to hearing the experiences from students like Jaila Kimbro of how Servant Leaders changed their lives for the better, being part of SLS will be such a memorable experience. Getting to connect with people who are also passionate about leadership and service is an amazing way to learn from others and grow. In addition to being able to build real-world skills such as problem-solving and time management and learning how to navigate my career with more confidence, what stands out to me about SLS is the community people build. Hearing about how SLS mentees have grown into more confident leaders and learned more ways to be a servant and leader in their community, making an impact through big and small actions, has led me to want to develop and grow through a unique experience like Servant Leaders. Being a part of this community would not only teach me how to be a leader but also make a positive difference in the life of others. I know being part of this group would surround me with people who give me the drive to be better. I look forward to being part of SLS to not only better myself and build unique connections but also to make me into a leader who has a lasting impact in my community.

     I have had an affinity towards technology since I was around five years old. My mother worked at IBM and would purchase refurbished laptops for me to explore. I loved understanding the inner workings of my laptops when I was younger, and my appreciation for technology bled into my early adulthood. I am currently in the Dual Degree Engineering Program at Spelman College, which is a 3 + 2 program where I will spend three years at Spelman College obtaining my bachelor’s degree in computer science and two years at a partnering engineering institution receiving my bachelor’s degree in computer engineering.

   Ultimately, after finishing my computer science degree at Spelman College and my computer engineering degree at a partnering institution, I want to pursue a career in software engineering with a focus on robotics. I believe it is essential for Black women to be in the tech industry mainly because there are not a lot of Black women in computer science or computer engineering. I intend for my presence in the industry to help inspire others to pursue computer science. To ensure diversity in the STEM demographics occurs, I want to develop a nonprofit that targets Black and Brown youth in underserved communities, especially in metro Atlanta. The nonprofit will inspire and empower young, dynamic students to pursue further education, especially in engineering and technology, so that the next generation of engineers can be from diverse backgrounds.

     Despite my early passion for technology, I initially started at Spelman College as a chemistry major. I truly believed that the world of chemicals was my calling when I first arrived at Spelman; however, all of the student organizations that I joined at Spelman were based around technology and engineering. I realized a month into my first semester that I needed to change my major to computer science because I knew that it was my calling. Despite not taking the introductory Python course in my first semester of freshman year, I still wanted to apply for computer science internships for the following summer. I applied to several programs for freshmen and sophomores, but I did not feel confident that I would perform well in technical interviews. In order to catch up with my peers who had already taken their introductory Python course, I spoke with an upperclassman computer science major who was able to guide me and help me learn Python over the winter break. I was adamant that I would receive an internship offer for the summer, so I studied as much as I could within the month time frame. 

   Thankfully, the more I studied, the more confident I became, and the more in interviews I was receiving from companies. By the beginning of February 2024, I had interviewed with both NVIDIA and Microsoft, and I received internship offers from both companies. I decided to intern at NVIDIA, which allowed me to explore robotics despite not being entirely familiar with the field. I appreciated my experience this past summer, and it allowed me to understand my future career goals in technology.

     The Servant Leader Scholars program will provide me with the necessary network, preparation, and empowerment to succeed in the traditional workplace and with community-based work. I genuinely want to be a servant leader within metro Atlanta because the metro Atlanta community has raised me. I have a deep appreciation for Atlanta and I want to see the people within it thrive. Because I have lived in metro Atlanta my whole life, I understand the needs of the community, and I know how to reach out to the community to address specific needs. The Servant Leader Scholars program can help me refine my skills and be able to lead projects that will have significant impacts on the community. In traditional professional spaces, I hope that the Servant Leader Scholars program can help me feel comfortable with interviewing for impactful companies and networking with dynamic professionals. Participating in the program will allow me to grow into a leader who reinvests into Atlanta the way that Atlanta has invested in me.

However, I cannot gain the so-coveted professional experience without developing my ability to communicate, interact, and network with those in the professional world. This led me to create several career goals relating to improving my engineering and networking skill sets. As a result, I set towards working on at least 1 collaborative team/personal project per semester to improving on my engineering skill set. Additionally, I began to practice developing my communication skills both in writing and verbally through reports and presentations, earning relevant certification towards my career path, and interacting with recruiters and engineers in the workforce to improve my networking skills. Finally, I ensured to consistently participate in professional organizations such as the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), contributing my developing skill sets (professional and personal) to the organizations and developing healthy relationships with my fellow students and/or engineers.

     As the Fall 2024 semester came to a close, I realized my need to improve on my engineering skill sets. Rather than relying solely on projects completed through coursework, I decided to embark on a personal project of my own during the Christmas break, A Holiday-themed Music Box. Using the techniques and insights I obtained from my Introduction to Engineering Design class, I began to work on my first personal project. This project helped me to solidify my computer-aided design rendering and product ideation skills. Although I had started developing my product ideation and design skills, these skills would be rendered useless if I lacked the ability to communicate the ideation process verbally and in written - a problem I constantly encountered when speaking with recruiters in career fairs and in interviews. As a result, I enrolled in Georgia Tech’s Creative Decisions and Design course, a course with a major focus on teaching students how to communicate their design choices in reports and presentations. However, this was done with the goal to apply this skill to all aspects of my professional and personal life such as when communicating my personal aspirations and career journey.
Moving on, I applied for and was accepted into Deloitte’s Salesforce Career Journey. This virtual program that takes place in March 2025 provides me with the opportunity to build skills, explore a career in the Salesforce and consulting ecosystem, hear from current practitioners on their experiences with Salesforce, and gain essential interview/networking tips and tricks to use in the recruitment process. Finally, I began developing relationships with members of the Georgia Tech chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers (GTSBE) by contributing to the Academic Excellence and Publications committees where I ensure high-quality documentation of key Academic Excellence events through photography and design the annual GTSBE magazine for the Publications committee.

      How Can SLS Help?: How do you feel your participation in the Servant Leader Scholars program would help you achieve your early career goals?
     </b>
    </td>
    <td>
     As mentioned in my early career journey, a major issue I decided to work on was my ability to communicate my skills and experiences with recruiters during interviews and career fairs. After attending the Servant Leader Scholars Campus Pop-Up with Georgia Tech’s Society of Black Engineers and listening to the testimonies of Georgia Tech SLS Alums (Jaila Kimbro and Najma Noor), I was convinced that this program would enable me to confidently articulate my skills and experiences in an interview setting post-program. However, beyond interview preparation, the program would instil the courage to go out to my community (even beyond Georgia Tech and Atlanta), address the issues within said communities, and uplift members of said communities.
As a non-USA native, I find it quite easy to feel out of place within my community, but this program would create an avenue for me to actively practice servant leadership within my school, community, and in my future career as I interact with individuals from various backgrounds and ethnicities during the program. Lastly, through community service and civic engagement projects such as the Annual Day of Service, I will be able to connect with members of the Georgia community, fostering a sense of responsibility, and promoting reinvestment within the community.

     My early career goals focus on developing expertise in project management, marketing strategy, and leadership to build a strong foundation for my future career. Through hands-on experiences such as managing Muev’s client projects, I aim to refine my ability to lead teams, deliver strategic campaigns, and drive results. Additionally, I plan to further expand my business knowledge by securing an internship and pursuing more diverse coursework, including a media certificate and data analyst emphasis.

I also aspire to provide support and resources for others through my role as a Keystone board member for BBSA. I believe in the importance of mentorship and creating opportunities for underrepresented groups in business. By focusing on these goals, I hope to become a well-rounded professional capable of excelling in marketing leadership roles while driving positive change in my community.

     My early career journey has been a path of growth, discovery, and self-reinvention. I initially began as a civil engineering major, drawn to problem-solving and structure. However, I soon realized that my passion lay elsewhere. After joining the Student Government Association as their Director of Visual Content, I discovered a deep interest in marketing, creativity, and strategic communication. That pivotal experience inspired me to switch my major to marketing.

Since then, I've thrived by managing projects, including my current role with Muev, a pickleball brand, where I lead a client team to develop impactful marketing strategies. Along the way, I’ve also embraced my love for media, sparked in high school through creative projects like music video production. Despite early struggles with balancing creative and technical work, I’ve developed resilience, learning to manage time effectively while growing my leadership and collaboration skills. This journey has shaped me into a motivated and adaptable professional.

     Participation in the Servant Leader Scholars program would help me strengthen key leadership, communication, and project management skills essential for my early career goals. Through mentorship and collaboration with like-minded peers, I would learn to balance leading others while continuing to grow personally and professionally. This aligns with my goal of becoming a well-rounded leader in marketing, capable of managing teams and delivering strategic business solutions.

The program would also help me refine my problem-solving and adaptability by exposing me to new perspectives and challenges. Developing these skills will allow me to thrive in high-pressure, fast-paced environments and position me to take on more responsibility in future roles. Additionally, the opportunity to connect with mentors and peers would provide valuable guidance and support as I continue to build a foundation for long-term career success.

     As I continue my studies in college, I have been provided the opportunity to move forward with gaining a deeper understanding of business whilst exploring the work of volunteerism and leaving a positive impact. I have continued my look into joining additional clubs finding many that offer a chance to persist with strengthening my ability to lead without discouragement. Along with not only receiving an education, I have been met with help to improve my speaking up and working with others through the current courses I am enrolled in. With these current goals set in mind, I have gained the encouragement to push myself to keep working up as I take into account the sources of support through this journey. Achieving a degree and being given the opportunity to give back allows me to leave a positive impact on myself and others and contribute to the community as a whole. With the idea of giving back and playing an impactful part to build and assure others that it is possible.

     As I move forward in my journey in school, I have brought myself to acknowledge the available opportunities to take part in the work of volunteerism and learn from others while advancing my abilities in marketing. With the plenty of tasks that needed to be done, I would find myself having difficulties better managing my time and getting easily distracted as I had once overcome. This helped me realize that I needed to hold myself accountable and improve my self-discipline. Through the numerous resources and support at hand, I found myself reading into and joining clubs, as well as coming into contact with the same people who helped me get to where I am now. Through these experiences, whether expected or not, I have been able to say that I am grateful for each one and what followed. I have accomplished not overcomplicating things, but simply "going with the flow".
